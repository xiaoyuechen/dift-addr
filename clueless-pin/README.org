#+title: Clueless

A binary instrumentation tool that tracks values leaking as memory addresses.

* Dependency
Clueless depends on [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html][Intel Pin]]. You need to install it and set environment variable ~PIN_ROOT~ to the root of your pin installation. For convenience, also add ~pin~ to your path.

* Usage
Fist, run ~make~ to compile the tool.

To instrument any program, run ~pin -t obj-intel64/dift-addr.so -- you-program~.

To get help on the options, run ~pin -t obj-intel64/dift-addr.so -h -- you-program~.
